\begin{frame}{Analogy in Logical Reasoning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analogy is a logical reasoning question type where a relationship between pairs of words is given, and a similar relationship needs to be identified among a different pair of words.
    \item These problems assess a candidate's ability to recognize and apply logical connections between concepts.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analogy questions are common in various competitive exams and require a keen understanding of relationships between words.
    \item Analyzing the nature of the relationship is crucial for solving these problems.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types of Analogies}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Semantic Analogies:} Based on the meanings or definitions of words.
    \item \textbf{Symbolic Analogies:} Involving symbols, signs, or mathematical operations.
    \item \textbf{Classification Analogies:} Based on the classification or categorization of words.
    \item \textbf{Number Analogies:} Involving numerical relationships.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Where it is Used in Real Life}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Language Understanding:} Recognizing relationships between words enhances linguistic reasoning.
    \item \textbf{Problem-Solving:} Applying analogies in various fields for creative problem-solving.
    \item \textbf{Education:} Enhancing critical thinking and analytical skills.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Strategies for Analogies}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Understand the Relationship:} Analyze the given pair of words to understand the nature of the relationship.
    \item \textbf{Apply the Relationship:} Apply the identified relationship to the new pair of words.
    \item \textbf{Eliminate Incorrect Options:} Eliminate answer choices that do not follow the established relationship.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Worked Out Example - Semantic Analogies}
  \textbf{Example:} Cat is to Feline as Dog is to \_\_\_\_\_\_.

  \textbf{Solution:} The relationship is that "Cat" is a specific type of "Feline," so the analogous relationship is that "Dog" is a specific type of "Canine."

\begin{frame}{Reasoning for Analogy Solution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Analogy problems test your ability to recognize and apply relationships between words.
    \item For the given example, we identified the semantic relationship and applied it logically.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Exercise for Students}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Solve a set of semantic analogies to practice recognizing word relationships.
    \item Explore symbolic analogies involving symbols, signs, or mathematical operations.
    \item Practice classification analogies and number analogies to enhance logical reasoning skills.
  \end{enumerate}
