\begin{frame}{Number Series in Logical Reasoning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Number Series is a common type of logical reasoning question where a sequence of numbers is given, and a pattern or rule needs to be identified.
    \item These problems assess a candidate's ability to recognize numerical patterns and sequences.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Number series questions are frequently encountered in competitive exams and require a logical approach to decipher the pattern.
    \item Understanding arithmetic, geometric, or other mathematical progressions is crucial for solving these problems.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Types of Number Series}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Arithmetic Series:} Where the difference between consecutive terms is constant.
    \item \textbf{Geometric Series:} Where the ratio between consecutive terms is constant.
    \item \textbf{Square and Cube Series:} Involving squares or cubes of numbers in the series.
    \item \textbf{Mixed Series:} Combining different types of progressions in a sequence.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Where it is Used in Real Life}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Analysis:} Recognizing patterns in numerical data sets.
    \item \textbf{Financial Analysis:} Identifying trends in financial data.
    \item \textbf{Mathematical Modeling:} Building models based on observed number patterns.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Strategies for Number Series}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Difference or Ratio Analysis:} Examine the difference or ratio between consecutive terms.
    \item \textbf{Identify Patterns:} Look for patterns involving squares, cubes, or other mathematical operations.
    \item \textbf{Trial and Error:} Test possible progressions to identify the underlying rule.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Worked Out Example - Arithmetic Series}
  \textbf{Example:} Identify the pattern in the series - \(2, 5, 8, 11, 14, \cdot\)

  \textbf{Solution:} The pattern is increasing by 3 each time, so the next term is 17.

\begin{frame}{Reasoning for Arithmetic Series Solution}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Arithmetic series problems test your ability to recognize and extend patterns involving constant differences.
    \item For the given example, we identified the arithmetic progression and extended it logically.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exercise for Students}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Solve a set of arithmetic and geometric number series to practice pattern recognition.
    \item Explore square and cube series problems and identify the underlying rules.
    \item Combine different progressions in mixed series questions and decipher the patterns.
  \end{enumerate}
