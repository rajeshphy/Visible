\begin{frame}{Blood Relations in Logical Reasoning}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Blood Relations is a logical reasoning question type where relationships between family members need to be established based on given information.
    \item These problems assess a candidate's ability to understand and interpret family relationships.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Blood Relations questions are commonly found in competitive exams and require a logical approach to deduce family connections.
    \item Understanding the terms used to represent relationships (like father, mother, brother, etc.) is crucial for solving these problems.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Types of Blood Relations Problems}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Direct Relationships:} Establishing relationships between given family members.
    \item \textbf{Coded Relationships:} Deciphering coded information to determine relationships.
    \item \textbf{Mixed Relationships:} Combining different types of family relationships in a single problem.
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{frame}{Strategies for Blood Relations}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Understand Family Terms:} Be familiar with terms like father, mother, brother, sister, etc.
    \item \textbf{Draw Family Trees:} Create family trees to visualize relationships and connections.

\begin{frame}{Worked Out Example - Direct Relationships}
  \textbf{Example:} If A is the brother of B, and B is the sister of C, what is the relationship between A and C?

  \textbf{Solution:} A is the brother of B, and B is the sister of C, so A is the brother of C.
