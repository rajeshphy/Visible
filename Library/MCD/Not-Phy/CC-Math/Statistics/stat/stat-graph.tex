\begin{frame}{Graphical Representation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Graphical representation is a powerful tool in statistics to visually communicate data and highlight patterns, trends, and insights.
    \item Various types of graphs and charts are used to present data effectively.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Introduction}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Graphs provide a way to present complex data in a clear and concise manner.
    \item They enhance understanding and facilitate comparisons between different sets of data.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Where it is Used in Real Life}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Business:} Sales trends, market share, and financial performance are often presented graphically.
    \item \textbf{Education:} Academic performance, exam results, and attendance can be visualized through graphs.
    \item \textbf{Healthcare:} Patient statistics, disease prevalence, and treatment outcomes are frequently represented graphically.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Types of Graphs}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bar Charts:} Used to compare categories of data.
    \item \textbf{Histograms:} Display the distribution of a continuous variable.
    \item \textbf{Line Charts:} Show trends and changes over time.
    \item \textbf{Pie Charts:} Illustrate the proportions of a whole.
    \item \textbf{Scatter Plots:} Depict the relationship between two variables.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Worked Out Example}
  \textbf{Example:} Create a bar chart representing the monthly sales of a store for the year 2022.

  \textbf{Solution:}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Collect monthly sales data.
    \item Choose an appropriate scale and axis.
    \item Draw bars corresponding to each month's sales.
    \item Label the axes and provide a title for clarity.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Exercise for Students}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Create a histogram for the given dataset: [15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60].
    \item Design a line chart to show the temperature variations over a week.
    \item Discuss a real-life scenario where graphical representation played a crucial role in decision-making.
  \end{enumerate}
